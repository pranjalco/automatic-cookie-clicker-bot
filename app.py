# Project 33:Automatic Cookie Clicker Bot

## Author
- **Name**: Pranjal Sarnaik  
- **Date**: 27 Jan 2025  

## Description
An automated game-playing bot created using Selenium and Python to play the **Cookie Clicker** game. The bot clicks the cookie continuously, evaluates affordable upgrades every 5 seconds, and buys the most expensive one to maximize cookies per second. The bot stops after 5 minutes and displays the "cookies/second" rate achieved during the session.

## How to Use
1. Visit the game website: [Cookie Clicker Classic Version](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/).  
2. Run the bot to automate gameplay, and let it manage upgrades for the best performance.  
3. Observe how efficiently the bot increases cookies per second!  

## Level
- **Level**: Intermediate  
- **Skills**: Python, Selenium, Automation  
- **Domain**: Game Bot Development  

## Features
- Automates cookie clicking.  
- Checks for affordable upgrades every 5 seconds.  
- Prioritizes the most expensive upgrade within budget.  
- Stops after 5 minutes and displays the cookies-per-second rate achieved.  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranjalco/automatic-cookie-clicker-bot.git
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd automatic-cookie-clicker-bot
   ```  

3. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```  

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Python 3.9 or later is installed on your system.  
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.  
3. Execute the program:  
   ```bash
   app.py
   ```  

## File Structure
- **app.py**: The main bot script.  
- **experiments/**: Temporary or practice files.  
- **screenshots/**: Program screenshots.  
- **README.md**: Project documentation.  

## Output
- After 5 minutes, the bot stops and displays the "cookies/second" rate in the terminal.
